# EIGRP Congestion Control Report

This repository contains an academic report that studies **congestion control and traffic handling mechanisms in the Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP)**.

## Introduction
EIGRP is a dynamic routing protocol developed by Cisco that combines features of distance-vector and link-state routing protocols. While EIGRP does not implement congestion control in the same way as transport-layer protocols, it plays an important role in **traffic optimization, bandwidth utilization, and congestion avoidance** at the network layer.

## Objectives
The main objectives of this report are:
- To explain how EIGRP manages network traffic
- To analyze EIGRP metrics and their impact on congestion
- To study the role of bandwidth, delay, and load in route selection
- To evaluate EIGRP behavior during network congestion
- To compare EIGRP traffic handling with other routing protocols
